mimosa-import-source
===========

## Overview

This is a Mimosa module for copying files from somewhere onto the file system and into your project as the first step of a build/watch. This allows, among other things, files from other projects to merge with files from the project using this module, giving the appearance of a single codebase.

For more information regarding Mimosa, see http://mimosajs.com

## Usage

Add `'import-source'` to your list of modules.  That's all!  Mimosa will install the module for you when you start up.

## Functionality


## Default Config

```
importSource:[]
```

## Example Config

If this module had a default config placeholder like other Mimosa modules, it would look something like this:

```
